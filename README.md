i dont want to chase you or wait for you but i dont want you to leave either https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQOrXHG7O78 its qawali, you can find the translation in the comments, hes says dont leave

Tu murh ke na jaa veen hon sajna
Main teriyaan rawaan takdi phiraan
Main raj ke tenu hon taklaan
Tu murh ke na jaa veen hon sajna
Sajna tu na ja sajna
Tenu aj taklaan
Tere vich meri jaan
Tu na jaa
